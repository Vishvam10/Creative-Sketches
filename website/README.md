# Creative Coding Website
A compilation of all my previous creative coding experiments. Tech stack to be used : 

- **Layout and design :** HTML5, CSS3 ( + Tailwind ) and Highway.js 
- **Logic and function :** Javascript and p5.js

<br>

# Todo
- [] Create a template file for the base layout
- [] Dynamically add / remove scripts for different visuals
- [] Configure webapck / parcel to handle external modules
- [] Add `highway.js` at some point to handle transitions
